  * Events are colour coded for each calendar.
  * Place the mouse cursor over an event to see the full event details.
  * Clicking on an event jumps to that day in your calendar.
  * Click on a news item to read the article right in Zimbra mail.

  * Calendars (and news feeds) can be hidden from the sidebar by prefixing their name with a tilde (~) character (e.g. "~Vacation".)
